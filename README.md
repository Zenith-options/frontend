# Zenith Frontend

Next.js 14 (App Router) options trading terminal for Zenith, a decentralized
options protocol on Stellar Soroban. Options chain, portfolio, trade history,
multi-leg strategy builder, and a vol surface — all in a dense,
Bloomberg-style dark UI.

## Status: wired up to the real backend

Account, positions, trade history, watchlist, and alerts all come from the
real backend API now (`src/lib/api/*.ts`), not `localStorage` — the local
zustand stores for those were removed once the backend versions replaced
them; `src/lib/store/` now holds only `wallet.ts`. A shared WebSocket
connection (`src/lib/context/SpotFeedContext.tsx`) feeds live spot/vol
ticks into the options chain and portfolio pages. Wallet sign-in is a real
end-to-end flow: connect via Freighter → request a nonce → sign it with
`freighterApi.signBlob` → exchange it at `POST /api/bff/session`, which
verifies with the backend and keeps the bearer token in an encrypted
httpOnly cookie. The BFF attaches it server-side to every authed request
(see "Session & hydration" below). That said, the signature encoding
hasn't been manually confirmed against a live Freighter extension (no
extension available in this environment) — the flow is logically complete,
not hardware-tested.

Client-side Black-Scholes pricing (`src/lib/pricing.ts`) hasn't gone away —
it's now a fallback and preview layer rather than the primary source: the
options chain falls back to it if the backend fetch fails, per-row live
Greeks in the positions table are computed locally rather than
round-tripped, and multi-leg strategy *preview* pricing (before execution)
is local-only. The backend's `/api/v1/portfolio/payoff` endpoint has a
typed client (`src/lib/api/payoff.ts`) but nothing in the app calls it yet —
the payoff diagram still uses local math (`src/lib/payoff.ts`).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm run dev
# http://localhost:3000
```

Configuration is validated in `src/env.ts`. Local development defaults to the
backend at `http://localhost:8081`; production builds require an API URL,
selected Stellar network, and a valid contract ID for that network. The
runtime `/api/runtime-config` endpoint lets the same tagged image use separate
staging and production settings. See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for release,
deployment, and rollback setup.

Run the [backend](https://github.com/Zenith-options/backend) alongside it
(`cargo run`, default port 8081) for account/positions/history/watchlist/
alerts/live spot to actually load — without it, only the home page's local
preview chain and the options chain's client-side BS fallback will render.

```bash
npm run build      # production build
npm run lint       # next lint
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm test           # unit + React Testing Library tests (Vitest, jsdom)
npm run test:e2e   # Playwright: desktop Chrome, iPhone 13 (WebKit), Pixel 7
```

The Playwright suite builds and starts the app itself and fakes the backend
per test (`e2e/mockBackend.ts`), so no backend needs to be running. WebKit
needs system libraries: `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium webkit`.
Visual baselines live in `e2e/*-snapshots/`, one per device and platform; a
device with no committed baseline skips its visual test. Generate one with
`npx playwright test --project=<device> --update-snapshots`.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, typecheck, unit tests and build;
the Playwright suite with a video of every test (uploaded as the
`playwright-report` artifact); and Lighthouse CI on a 375px mobile profile
(`lighthouserc.json`), which fails if CLS exceeds 0.05 or the mobile
performance score drops below 0.85 on any page.

A render performance harness (dev-only) lives at `http://localhost:3000/__perf` — drives four scripted tick sequences through real components and exports JSON metrics. See [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for the full guide, hotspot fixes, and CI setup.

## Environment modes: Paper, Testnet, Mainnet

The terminal always runs in exactly one mode, chosen in the header
(`src/components/env/EnvironmentSelector.tsx`). Every per-network setting
(API URL, Soroban RPC, network passphrase, contract IDs, colors) lives in one
typed registry, `src/lib/env/networks.ts`, configured through the env vars
in `.env.local.example`.

- **Impossible to miss:** a full-width banner and a page frame on every page
  (dashed slate for paper, amber for testnet, red for mainnet), a
  `[PAPER]`/`[TESTNET]`/`[MAINNET]` title prefix, a mode-colored favicon, and
  a mode stamp at the top of every confirm dialog. An inline `<head>` script
  applies the persisted mode before first paint, so mainnet never flashes
  as paper.
- **Impossible to mix:** persisted state is namespaced per mode
  (`zenith:<mode>:wallet` and so on, in `src/lib/env/storage.ts`). The API
  client resolves its base URL from the active mode on every call, and
  refuses to fall back when a mode has no backend configured. All in-memory
  data providers are keyed by mode (`src/components/AppProviders.tsx`), so a
  switch discards every cache rather than showing the old mode's data.
- **Guarded:** switching to mainnet always needs an explicit
  acknowledgement, and is refused while a connected Freighter wallet is on
  another network. If Freighter changes network mid-session (it's polled every
  3s), trading is blocked until it matches. A `?mode=testnet` or `?mode=paper`
  link switches directly; `?mode=mainnet` only ever raises a prompt.

## Loading, empty, error and signed-out states

Every data surface (chain, positions, portfolio, history, watchlist, alerts,
account chip, risk panel) renders exactly one of: a layout-matching
skeleton, a signed-out prompt with a connect CTA, a recoverable error with
retry, an empty state with a next step, or the data. The pieces are:

- `src/lib/query.ts`: `useAsyncQuery`, an explicit `idle | loading |
  success | error` status per query. It discards responses for a stale key and
  keeps the last good data (flagged) when a background refresh fails. A 401
  clears the session, so surfaces fall back to signed-out.
- `src/components/states/`: `Skeleton`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorState`,
  `AuthGate`, and `DataBoundary`, which picks the right one from a query and
  the auth status. Pre-hydration, auth is "unknown" and renders the
  skeleton, which is what SSR rendered too.
- Balances are `null` until loaded and never render as `$0.00`. Skeleton
  shimmer is off under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Phones and tablets

- ≤1024px: the market sidebar becomes a **Market** tab, tabs scroll and
  respond to swipes, and the order ticket opens as a focus-trapped **bottom
  sheet** (`src/components/BottomSheet.tsx`) that can be dragged down to
  dismiss and lifts above the on-screen keyboard.
- ≤640px chain container (a container query): one side at a time behind a
  Calls/Puts toggle, with a sticky strike column.
- Portfolio, history and positions tables become expandable cards (container
  queries, `src/components/ExpandableCard.tsx`).
- Payoff charts size to their container and support a touch or mouse
  crosshair, pinch/ctrl-wheel zoom, and keyboard control
  (`src/lib/hooks/useChartGestures.ts`).
- Tap targets are ≥44×44 on touch and narrow layouts. Full-height pages use
  `dvh` and respect the safe-area insets.

## Onboarding and education (`src/features/onboarding/`)

- **Tour:** chain → ticket → confirm → portfolio. It's skippable, pausable
  (Esc) and resumable from the header's **?** menu, and its progress
  persists. Steps anchor to `data-tour` attributes, not CSS classes, and
  re-measure on resize, scroll and DOM changes. When an anchor isn't on
  screen, the step explains how to get there.
- **Glossary:** `<Term id="theta">` gives any term an accessible definition
  that works on hover, focus and tap, meeting WCAG 1.4.13 (dismissible,
  hoverable, persistent). Used for every Greek and trading term in the
  terminal, portfolio and history.
- **Plain-language summaries:** every trade confirmation is described by the
  pure `describeTrade(legs, context)`. It computes exact breakevens, max
  loss and max profit from the piecewise-linear payoff, for example: "You're
  selling 2 BTC 70k calls expiring in 30 days. You collect $3,000.00 now. If
  BTC is above $71,500.00 at expiry you lose money; losses are unlimited
  above that."
- **Practice mode:** confirmations simulate the trade locally and send
  nothing, with no wallet needed.
- All copy lives in `content/<locale>/*.json` (glossary, tour, trade
  templates), ready for i18n.

## Pages

| Route | What's there |
|---|---|
| `/` | Marketing/landing page, live preview chain, watchlist |
| `/options` | The terminal: chain, positions, strategy builder, vol surface, customizable workspace (≥1024px) |
| `/portfolio` | Open positions marked-to-market, partial/batch/strategy close, roll, CSV export, portfolio risk, P&L attribution |
| `/history` | Full trade ledger (opens + closes) with realized P&L stats, performance analytics (equity curve, drawdown, breakdowns) |
| `/calendar` | Expiry calendar (month/list), settlement center, `.ics` download |

The `/options` page is tabbed below 1024px (and via the Tabs toggle):

- **Chain** — configurable columns, strike windows (±N / delta), ATM jump, optional dual-expiry compare. Click an ask to buy, a bid to write.
- **Positions** — quick view of open positions for the selected symbol;
  "Manage →" links to `/portfolio` for the actual close/roll actions.
- **Strategies** — templated multi-leg trades (straddle, bull call spread,
  bear put spread, iron condor) with a combined payoff diagram, executed
  atomically.
- **Surface** — an IV heatmap across strikes and expiries, with a simple
  term-structure model (skew dampens for longer-dated options).

On wide viewports, **Workspace** mode (react-grid-layout) lets you drag/resize
panels (chain, ticket, payoff, spot, smile, positions, alerts, surface,
strategies), apply Trader / Vol / Writer presets, and save/export/import
layouts per wallet.

Pages live under `src/app/[locale]/`. English is served unprefixed and
Spanish and Portuguese at `/es/…` and `/pt/…`. See [docs/i18n.md](docs/i18n.md).
Security headers and CSP: [docs/security-headers.md](docs/security-headers.md).
Clear-signing: [docs/clear-signing.md](docs/clear-signing.md).

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `⌘/Ctrl+K` or `/` | Command palette (fuzzy search; recent commands) |
| `?` | Shortcut help overlay |
| `1`–`4` | Chain / Positions / Strategies / Surface tabs |
| `[` / `]` | Previous / next expiry |
| `B` / `S` | Open buy / write ticket on focused strike (confirm still required) |
| `A` | Jump to ATM |
| `⇧P` / `⇧H` / `⇧O` | Portfolio / History / Options |

Hotkeys are disabled inside text inputs. Bindings persist in
`localStorage` (`zenith.hotkeys.v1`). Palette commands like "BTC 30D",
"buy call", "go portfolio", "toggle surface" are registered via
`src/components/command/registry.ts`.

## Architecture

Options module map (`src/app/options/_components/`): `MarketHeader` (symbol
tabs, spot, expiries), `MarketSidebar`, `ViewTabs`, `ChainTable` +
`useOptionChain` (fetch, 4s polling, Black-Scholes fallback), `TradeTicket` +
`useTradeTicket` (validation, collateral, funds), `PositionsTab`,
`StrategiesTab` + `useStrategyPreview`, `SurfaceTab`, `PortfolioBar`,
`StatusBar`. `page.tsx` only composes them.

### Session & hydration (BFF, #118)

The backend bearer token is **never** stored in `localStorage` or exposed to
JavaScript. Authed calls go through a backend-for-frontend:

```
browser ──fetch /api/bff/<backend path>──▶ Next.js route handler ──Bearer <token>──▶ zenith-backend
          (httpOnly session cookie)        src/app/api/bff/[...path]/route.ts
```

- **Sign-in:** the wallet signs the nonce, then `POST /api/bff/session` sends
  the signature. The BFF calls `/api/v1/auth/verify` and seals the token with
  AES-256-GCM (key from `BFF_SESSION_SECRET`) into an `HttpOnly; Secure;
  SameSite=Strict` cookie. The cookie is named `__Host-zenith_session` in
  production and `zenith_session` on http://localhost. The response carries
  only `{ authenticated, wallet_address, expires_at }`.
- **Proxy:** only allowlisted paths and methods are forwarded
  (`src/lib/bff/allowlist.ts`). Everything else returns 404 or 405, so this
  is not an open proxy. Bodies are streamed in both directions. Browser
  cookies never reach the backend, and backend `Set-Cookie` headers never
  reach the browser.
- **CSRF:** mutating routes need a same-origin `Origin` header (or
  `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`) and an `x-zenith-csrf` header matching the
  JS-readable `zenith_csrf` cookie. `GET /api/bff/session` mints that cookie.
- **Logout:** `DELETE /api/bff/session` clears the cookie, which is shared
  by all tabs. `src/lib/tabs/session.ts` broadcasts the change so other tabs
  update immediately.
- **WebSockets:** the spot and chain feeds are public, so they connect
  directly and need no ticket. An authed feed would need a short-lived
  ticket route in the BFF.
- **Latency:** every proxied response carries
  `Server-Timing: upstream;dur=…, bff;dur=…`. Deploy the frontend in the same
  region as the backend. Self-hosting and Docker need no extra service, since
  the BFF is part of `next start`.

Server-only env vars: `BFF_SESSION_SECRET` (required in production,
≥32 chars, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 48`), `BFF_UPSTREAM_URL` (backend
origin as the server sees it, defaults to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`),
`BFF_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (extra origins for mutating calls, comma-separated),
and `BFF_INSECURE_COOKIES=1` (plain-HTTP self-hosting only).

**Hydration.** `wallet.ts` is still persisted with `skipHydration: true`, and
`StoreHydrator` rehydrates it after mount. It now persists only the public
`address`. Store version 2's `migrate`, plus `purgeLegacyWalletToken()`, strip
any token left by older builds. Whether a session exists is asked of the BFF
(`checkConnection()` → `GET /api/bff/session`) after mount, so the server
HTML and the first client render still match. The store's `session` field is
a non-secret marker (`"bff-session"`), not a credential. Components that
gate fetching on it still wait for `useHydrated()` before fetching. Workspace
layouts also render the Trader preset on SSR and hydrate from localStorage
after mount.

## Close API contract (frontend)

Until the backend ships support, the client probes `GET /api/v1/features`
and falls back:

- `POST /api/v1/positions/{id}/close` with optional `{ contracts }` for partial close
- `POST /api/v1/strategies/{id}/close` for atomic strategy unwind
- Sequential per-leg closes with progress + stop/continue when unsupported
  (non-atomic leg risk is warned in the confirm dialog)

```bash
npm test          # node:test unit suite (attribution, analytics, expiry, alertRules)
```

## Known gaps

- The iPhone 13 (WebKit) Playwright project needs WebKit's system libraries,
  so it runs in CI. Its visual baseline has to be generated there (or on a
  machine with them) before its visual test stops being skipped.
- The mobile Lighthouse performance score for `/options` measured
  0.86–0.89 locally against the 0.85 gate. There isn't much headroom, and
  a slow CI runner may need a re-run.
- Testnet/mainnet modes are UI- and data-isolation-complete, but there's no
  Soroban transaction path yet: with no testnet/mainnet backend configured,
  those modes show market data from the local model and refuse trades.
- Unit tests cover heat scales, candles, vol-surface mesh, and scenario grid
  (`npm test`). General Playwright e2e suite not yet in CI (keyboard/drag flows).
- No RTL / component test suite yet (pure lib modules are covered).
- PWA: hand-written `public/sw.js` (no Serwist/Workbox dependency), production-only registration, SVG icons only (no PNG set), no Playwright offline tests and no Lighthouse run yet. Only last-known public spot prices are snapshotted (IndexedDB, wiped on disconnect); positions/account are not cached.
- Playwright e2e keyboard/drag flows are not in CI yet; unit coverage is via vitest.
- No on-chain/Soroban integration — the backend is a paper-trading API, not
  a wallet transaction signer against the contracts.
- Wallet sign-in (`signBlob` → verify → bearer token) hasn't been manually
  confirmed against a live Freighter extension — no extension available in
  this environment. The flow is logically complete, not hardware-tested.
- The home page's preview chain still runs its own local random-walk spot
  simulation rather than the shared WebSocket feed — only its watchlist i

- The backend's `/api/v1/portfolio/payoff` endpoint has a typed client
  (`src/lib/api/payoff.ts`) but nothing calls it — the payoff diagram still
  computes locally (`src/lib/payoff.ts`). Multi-leg strategy *preview*
  pricing (before execution) is also local-only, not backend-priced.
- `src/app/options/page.tsx` is now a composition shell; feature modules live
  in `src/app/options/_components/` (see Options module map above).
- The home page's preview chain still runs its own local random-walk spot
  simulation rather than the shared WebSocket feed — only its watchlist is
  backend-real.
- Accessibility is minimal — several controls (star toggle, alert form,
  contracts stepper) have no `aria-label`.

## API contracts

`src/lib/api/schemas.ts` holds a Zod schema per backend response; types in
`types.ts` are `z.infer`-derived. `request()` validates each response and throws
a `ContractError` (with per-field paths) on drift: shown in a dev overlay, sent
to `NEXT_PUBLIC_MONITOR_URL` in production. Extra backend fields are stripped;
numeric strings are coerced. `npm run api:check` validates the fixtures in
`contracts/fixtures/` (named after schema exports) and flags key drift.
