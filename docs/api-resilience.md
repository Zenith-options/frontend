# API client resilience

`src/lib/api/client.ts` sends every backend request through a composable
middleware stack in `src/lib/api/resilience/`:

```
apiGet / apiPost / apiDelete
  └─ withDedup     collapse identical in-flight GETs (method + URL + Authorization)
     └─ withRetry  idempotent-only retries, jittered backoff, Retry-After, per-origin budget
        └─ withBreaker  per-origin circuit breaker + Retry-After gate
           └─ withTimeout  per-attempt AbortController timeout (default 10s), linked to caller signal
              └─ fetch
```

Each middleware is a `(next: Fetcher) => Fetcher` and can be tested or reused
alone. `createResilientFetch(options)` builds the standard stack;
`setApiTransport()` swaps it (tests).

## Retry policy

| Request | Automatic retry? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` / `HEAD` / `OPTIONS` | Yes, up to 3 attempts | Network errors, timeouts, 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504 |
| `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH` / `DELETE` | **Never** | Replaying a trade can double-fill. The user re-confirms. |
| Any request, caller aborted | Never | |
| Any request, circuit open / inside Retry-After | Never (fails fast) | |

- **Backoff:** full jitter, `random(0, min(5s, 300ms · 2^attempt))`.
- **Retry-After (429/503):** parsed as seconds or HTTP-date. Waits up to 10s
  (plus up to 300ms of jitter so tabs don't wake up together). Longer
  windows go back to the caller as `ApiError { status: 429, reason: "rate_limited", retryAfterMs }`.
- **Budget:** per-origin token bucket. Each request adds 0.2 tokens and each
  retry spends 1, with a starting balance of 3 and a cap of 10. Retries stay
  at about 20% of traffic, so a failing backend isn't hit with 3x the load.
- TanStack Query does **not** retry `ApiError`s (`src/lib/api/queryPolicy.ts`),
  and mutations never retry.

## Circuit breaker (per origin)

`closed → open` after 5 consecutive failures (network error, timeout, 5xx
except 501). 4xx, 429 and aborts don't count either way. While the breaker is
`open`, requests reject right away with `ApiError { status: 503, reason: "circuit_open" }`
and never reach the network. POSTs are rejected too, so a trade is never sent
into an outage. After the cooldown (15s at first) the breaker goes
`half-open` and lets exactly one probe through. If the probe succeeds, the
breaker closes. If it fails, the breaker opens again and the cooldown doubles,
up to a cap of 2 minutes.

## Degraded-mode UX

`apiHealth` (`resilience/health.ts`) publishes per-origin breaker state and
Retry-After windows. `useApiHealth()` reads them and `<ApiHealthBanner>`
(mounted under `AppHeader`) shows a countdown:

- *Rate limited — pausing requests for 12s.*
- *Zenith backend degraded — showing last known data. Retrying in 9s.*

Polling queries use `refetchInterval: pollInterval(4000)`. The interval slows
to ≥30s while the API is degraded.

## Timeouts and cancellation

Every attempt has its own timeout (10s by default). You can override it per
call with `{ timeoutMs }`. Pass `{ signal }` (for example, TanStack Query's
`queryFn: ({ signal }) => …`) so that unmounting cancels the request. A
timeout surfaces as `ApiError { status: 408, reason: "timeout" }`. A caller
abort rejects with the native `AbortError`.

Deduplicated GETs are reference-counted. If one caller aborts, only that
caller detaches. The shared fetch is aborted only when every caller has
aborted.

## Idempotency key contract

Effectful POSTs (open, close, roll) accept `{ idempotencyKey }`, which is
sent as the `Idempotency-Key` header:

- The value is a UUID v4, scoped to the authenticated wallet.
- The backend stores `(wallet, key) → first response` for at least 24h:
  - If a repeat has the same key and the same body, the backend returns the
    stored response and executes nothing new.
  - If a repeat has the same key and a different body, the backend returns `422`.
  - If the first request is still in flight, the backend returns `409`. The
    client shows this as an error and the user can resubmit.
- Backends without support ignore the header, so it is always safe to send.

Key lifecycle (`IntentKeyManager` / `useIdempotencyKey`): one key per user
*intent*. Clicking Confirm again with the same parameters, for example after
a timeout, reuses the key. Changing any parameter, or a successful submit,
mints a new key.

```ts
const { keyFor, complete } = useIdempotencyKey();
await openPosition(params, token, { idempotencyKey: keyFor(params) });
complete();
```

## Tests

- `src/lib/api/resilience/__tests__/*` — unit tests with fake timers for every policy branch.
- `src/lib/api/__tests__/client.resilience.msw.test.ts` — MSW scenarios:
  flaky GET, POST 503, long and short 429, dedup, outage → open circuit,
  timeout, cancellation, hostile error strings.

Run `npm run test:coverage -- src/lib/api` to check coverage. The target is 90%
for `src/lib/api/resilience/**` and is enforced in `jest.config.js`.
