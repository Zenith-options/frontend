# Proposal Wizard (Issue #89)

Route: **`/governance/new`**

A four-step flow for drafting, simulating and submitting a governance proposal.

```
Details  →  Actions  →  Simulate  →  Review & submit
```

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib/governance/actions.ts` | Catalog of governable contracts/functions, typed argument encoding, form generation, human-readable summaries, danger rules |
| `src/lib/governance/strkey.ts` | Dependency-free Stellar `G…` / `C…` checksum validation |
| `src/lib/governance/simulation.ts` | Reads current on-chain values and renders `current → proposed` diffs |
| `src/lib/governance/draft.ts` | Versioned local draft persistence and metadata validation |
| `src/lib/governance/submit.ts` | Threshold gate, fee estimate, proposal payload, Soroban submission |
| `src/lib/governance/markdown.ts` | Safe Markdown subset for the body preview (AST, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) |
| `src/app/governance/new/page.tsx` | Route adapter |
| `src/app/governance/new/_components/` | `ProposalWizard` plus one component per step |

`ProposalWizard` takes every external dependency as a prop — `signer`, `proposer`,
`contractIds`, `governorContractId`, `thresholdState`, `reader` — so the flow renders
and is tested without a wallet, a network, or the Next.js router.

## Step 1 — Details

Title (8–120), summary (≤280), Markdown description (≥40) and an optional discussion
link restricted to `http`/`https`. The description is rendered live beside the form.

## Step 2 — Actions

Contract and function come from dropdowns populated by `GOVERNABLE_CONTRACTS`. Argument
inputs are **generated from the function's declared params** — adding a governable
function to the catalog needs no changes to the wizard.

Catalogued contracts: `market`, `vault`, `oracle`, `governor`, `timelock`, `deployer`.
Supported param types: `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `i128`, `bool`, `address`, `contract`,
`symbol`, `string`, `vec<address>`.

Each action renders a plain-English summary, e.g.

> Put collateral ratio → Collateral ratio 110%

Flagged as **high impact** (requires extra confirmation before submitting):
`market.set_paused`, `market.set_collateral_address`, `vault.set_paused`,
`oracle.set_feeds`, `timelock.set_admin`, `deployer.upgrade_contract`.

## Step 3 — Simulate

For every parameter with a `readMethod`, the current on-chain value is read through the
injected `ValueReader` and shown beside the proposed value with a delta and direction.
A read that fails is reported as a partial preview rather than blocking or hiding it.

This step is viewable even when actions are invalid, so errors are visible — but the flow
cannot advance to Review until the simulation is clean.

## Step 4 — Review and submit

Shows the rendered proposal, the proposer's threshold progress, and a fee estimate. High
impact proposals replace the submit button and require ticking an explicit acknowledgement.

Submission builds the `submit_proposal` argument tuple and forwards it through the shared
pipeline (`executeContractCall` + `createPipelineEventHandler`), so progress appears in
the normal transaction tracker and failed transactions remain retryable.

## Drafts

Autosaved (debounced 300 ms) to `localStorage` under `zenith_governance_proposal_draft`,
version-stamped. Reads are defensive: malformed or stale payloads fall back to an empty
draft instead of throwing. The draft is cleared only after a confirmed submission.

## Configuration

Contract IDs are read through `src/env.ts` (per the repo's `no-restricted-properties`
lint rule), with one optional variable per contract per network:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_GOVERNOR_TESTNET
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_MARKET_TESTNET
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_VAULT_TESTNET
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ORACLE_TESTNET
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_TIMELOCK_TESTNET
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_DEPLOYER_TESTNET
```

…and the matching `*_MAINNET` variables. All are optional; unset entries surface as a
"Contracts not configured" notice, and submission is refused rather than sent to a zero
address.

## Wiring the wallet

`src/lib/store/wallet.ts` is a **zero-byte file on `main`**, so this feature does not
import it. The route reads the signer from `ProposalSignerProvider`
(`_components/wallet.tsx`), which defaults to "not connected":

```tsx
<ProposalSignerProvider value={{ signer, address }}>
  {children}
</ProposalSignerProvider>
```

Wrap the app (or this route) in that provider once the wallet store is restored.

## Tests

```
npx jest src/lib/governance src/app/governance
```

219 tests: StrKey checksums, argument encoding, form generation, simulation diffs,
draft persistence, threshold/fee/submission, the Markdown parser, and RTL coverage of the
full four-step flow including the dangerous-action gate.
