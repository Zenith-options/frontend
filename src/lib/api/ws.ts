 * Subscribes to the backend's live spot-price feed. Calls `onUpdate`
 * with every snapshot (the immediate one on connect, then a tick every
 * ~2s) and `onClose` once if the connection drops or fails to open
 * (callers that want to reconnect should do so from there — this
 * function itself doesn't retry). Returns a cleanup function that
 * closes the socket and suppresses the pending onClose call.
