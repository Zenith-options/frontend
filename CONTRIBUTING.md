pipeline, and branch protection setup.

## Getting started

```bash
# Node version is pinned in .nvmrc — use nvm or volta to match it
nvm install   # reads .nvmrc automatically

npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local

npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

Run the [backend](https://github.com/Zenith-options/backend) alongside it
(`cargo run`, default port 8081) for account/positions/history/watchlist/
alerts/live spot to actually load.

---

## Development workflow

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Next.js dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint via `next lint` |
| `npm run lint:ci` | Lint with `--max-warnings 0` (used in CI) |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` — no emit, just types |
| `npm test` | Jest unit tests |
| `npm run test:ci` | Jest with coverage (used in CI) |
| `npm run build` | Production build (`next build`) |
| `npm run size` | Bundle budget check against `.next/` output |
| `npm run api:check` | Validate backend fixture contracts against Zod schemas |
| `npm run storybook` | Storybook dev server at `:6006` |

---

## CI pipeline

Every pull request targeting `main` triggers two workflows:

### `ci.yml` — main gate

Four jobs run in **parallel**. All four must pass before a PR can be merged.

```
┌─────────┐  ┌────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌───────┐
│  lint   │  │ typecheck  │  │    unit     │  │ build │
│         │  │            │  │ (coverage)  │  │       │
└─────────┘  └────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └───────┘
```

| Job | Command | Failure condition |
|---|---|---|
| **lint** | `npm run lint:ci` | Any ESLint error or warning |
| **typecheck** | `npm run typecheck` | Any TypeScript error |
| **unit** | `npm run test:ci` | Any failing test |
| **build** | `npm run build` | Build failure |

A coverage report artifact is uploaded on every run (14-day retention).

The build job restores `.next/cache` between runs for fast incremental builds,
and uploads the built `.next/` as an artifact so the bundle job can use it.

### `bundle.yml` — bundle size gate

Runs on every PR. Builds the PR branch, measures gzip sizes with
[size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit), and posts a comment to the
PR with the full budget table. It also builds the base branch to show a diff.

The job **fails if any budget is exceeded**, blocking the merge.

Example PR comment:

```
## ✅ Bundle budgets passed

|   | Name                               | Size (gzip) | Limit  | Diff vs base |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | Shared vendor bundle (largest chunk) | 211.2 kB   | 280 kB | —            |
| ✅ | React framework chunk              | 45.2 kB     | 60 kB  | —            |
| ✅ | Page: / (home)                     | 5.2 kB      | 10 kB  | —            |
| ✅ | Page: /options                     | 0.1 kB      | 5 kB   | —            |
| ✅ | Page: /portfolio                   | 25.6 kB     | 35 kB  | —            |
| ✅ | Page: /history                     | 5.8 kB      | 10 kB  | —            |
```

### `storybook.yml` — component tests (path-filtered)

Runs when `src/components/**`, `src/lib/**`, or `.storybook/**` change.
Builds Storybook, runs interaction + a11y tests, runs visual regression tests,
and publishes to GitHub Pages on `main`.

---

## Bundle budgets

Budgets are defined in the `"size-limit"` section of `package.json`.
Each entry is the **gzip size** of a specific chunk in the Next.js output.

To check sizes locally:

```bash
npm run build    # must run first — size-limit reads .next/
npm run size
```

To see what changed:

```bash
# Before your change
git stash
npm run build
npx size-limit --json > /tmp/base.json
git stash pop

# After your change
npm run build
npx size-limit --json > /tmp/pr.json

# Compare
diff /tmp/base.json /tmp/pr.json
```

### Raising a limit

If a budget legitimately needs to increase (e.g. a new required dependency),
update the relevant entry in `package.json → "size-limit"` in the same PR.
Include a brief justification in the PR description.

### Reducing the vendor bundle

The largest chunk (`~211 kB` gzip, budget `280 kB`) is the shared vendor
bundle. It currently includes:

- `@stellar/stellar-sdk` — the main driver; explore dynamic imports if possible
- `@creit.tech/stellar-wallets-kit`
- Zustand, React, Next.js internals

Use `ANALYZE=true npm run build` with `@next/bundle-analyzer` (add it as a dev
dep) to visualise the tree map.

## Branch protection setup

The following GitHub branch protection settings are recommended for `main`.
A repo admin can apply them at:

**Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule → `main`**

### Recommended rules

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Require a pull request before merging | ✅ | No direct pushes to `main` |
| Required approvals | **1** (or 2 for prod-sensitive changes) | Peer review |
| Dismiss stale reviews on new push | ✅ | Re-review after each fixup |
| Require status checks to pass before merging | ✅ | Gates on CI |
| **Required status checks** | See below | Block merges on failures |
| Require branches to be up to date before merging | ✅ | Prevent stale PRs |
| Require linear history | ✅ (optional) | Cleaner git log |
| Do not allow bypassing the above settings | ✅ | Admins too |

### Required status checks to add

Add each of these as a required check (they match the job names in the
workflow files):

```
Lint                  # ci.yml → lint
Typecheck             # ci.yml → typecheck
Unit Tests            # ci.yml → unit
Build                 # ci.yml → build
Bundle Budget Check   # bundle.yml → bundle
```

Optionally also require:

```
Build Storybook                   # storybook.yml (path-filtered)
Test Runner (interactions + a11y) # storybook.yml (path-filtered)
```

Note: path-filtered workflows only trigger when relevant files change. GitHub
marks them as "not run" (not "passed") when they are skipped due to path
filters — configure those checks as optional or use the
[`paths-ignore` workaround](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/troubleshooting-required-status-checks#handling-skipped-but-required-checks) to avoid blocking PRs that don't touch those paths.

### Applying via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install gh CLI: https://cli.github.com
gh api \
  --method PUT \
  /repos/Zenith-options/frontend/branches/main/protection \
  --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": ["Lint", "Typecheck", "Unit Tests", "Build", "Bundle Budget Check"]
  },
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 1,
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": true
  },
  "restrictions": null,
  "required_linear_history": false,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
EOF
```

## TypeScript strictness

The project uses `strict: false` with a manually curated set of strict
sub-flags enabled (see `tsconfig.json`). The currently enabled flags are:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `strictFunctionTypes` | Covariant/contravariant function parameter checking |
| `strictBindCallApply` | Strict types for `bind`/`call`/`apply` |
| `noImplicitThis` | Error on `this` with implicit `any` type |
| `useUnknownInCatchVariables` | Catch bindings typed as `unknown` |
| `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` | Array/index access returns `T \| undefined` |
| `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames` | Case-insensitive import errors |
| `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` | No implicit switch fallthrough |

The remaining strict flags (`strictNullChecks`, `noImplicitAny`) are not yet
enabled because they surface ~200+ pre-existing type errors that need to be
addressed incrementally. Tracked as a follow-up under
**TODO(#103-strict): enable `strict: true`**.

To check the current TypeScript error count:

```bash
npm run typecheck 2>&1 | grep "error TS" | wc -l
```

PRs that **fix** pre-existing type errors are welcome. PRs that **add new**
type errors will be blocked by the `Typecheck` required status check.
